👾 In this game, I built a fun Space Invaders style game using Python and Pygame! 🚀  
The player controls a spaceship 🛸 at the bottom of the screen, shoots bullets 💥, and tries to destroy falling enemies/chickens before they reach the ground.  

This game includes:  
✅ Player movement with keyboard controls  
✅ Bullet firing system 🔫  
✅ Enemy spawning 👾 and collision detection  
✅ Score counter 🏆 and lives system ❤️  
✅ Game over screen ☠️  

Perfect beginner-friendly project for anyone who wants to learn Python game development while making something exciting! 🎮
